Session 01 -

Assignments #1:


  1. Play with the demo code ( ConstDemo.cpp)  by initializing different values to const and constexpr note down the findings

  2. Write a small program to demonstrate const and constexpr for calculating area of a circle.


Assignment #2:

 1. Program to check datatype size and limits in C++

Assignment #3:

  1. Find out if some more functions are supported for string in C++

  2. A Word is said to be Magic Word if it satisfies following properties

       i. The word has at least six characters.
      ii. The word has even number of characters.
     iii. The word has first letter 'Z' or 'z'.
      iv. The word has last and First letter same.
       v. The word has two halves which are same.

     Write a program to take a word from user and print the total number of
     properties the word satisfies.

     Print "MAGIC Word" if word satisfies all the given properties.


Assignment #4:

 1. Observe output of following codes :
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	int x=8;
	cout<<" x= "<<x;
	cout<<" x= "<<x++;	//postfix increment
	cout<<" x= "<<x;
	cout<<" x= "<<x--;	//postfix decrement
	cout<<" x= "<<x;

	cout<<"\n x= "<<x;
	cout<<" x= "<<++x;	//prefix increment
	cout<<" x= "<<x;
	cout<<" x= "<<--x;	//prefix decrement
	cout<<" x= "<<x;
	return 0;
}

2. Observe output and play with the code.

 #include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
        int a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,k;
	a=8, b=4, c=2, d=1, e=5, f=20;
	cout<<"\t"<< a+b-(c+d)*3%e+f/9;
	a=17, b=5, c=6, d=3, e=5;
	cout<<"\t"<<a%6-b/2+(c*d-5)/e;
	a=4, b=5, c=6, d=3, e=5, f=10;
	cout<<"\t"<<a*b-c/d;
	a=8, b=5, c=8, d=3, e=65, f=10, g=2, h=5, k=2;
	cout<<"\t"<<(a-b+c/d);
	int r1 = a-b+c/d ;
	int r2 = (e/f-g+h%k);
        cout<<"\t"<<(r1 == r2);  //remove (   ) and check
	a=8, b=3, c=2, d=3, e=2, f=11;
	cout<<"\n"<<a-b||(a-b*c)+d&&e-f%3;
	return 0;
}


3. Observe output and play with the code.

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(void)
{
	int a=9,b=15,c=16,d=12,e,f;
	e = !(a<b || b<c);
	f = (a>b) ? a-b: b-a;
	cout<<" e = "<<e <<" f = "<< f;
	return 0;
}


4. Observe output and play with the code.

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(void)
{
    int x,y,z,k=10;
    k+=(x=5, y=x+2, z=x+y);
	cout<<"\n x = "<<x <<" y = "<< y <<" z = "<<z<< " k = "<<k;
    return 0;
}
 

Assignment #5 : Basic assignments on condition and loops :

1. Print table of a given number.
2. Take a number from user and print it is prime or not
3. Take a number from user and print sum of its digits.
4. Take a number from user and print it is perfect number or not.
5. Menu driven program for small hotel menu and print total bill amount, when user enter Exit choice.
6. An electricity board charges the following rates to domestic users to discourage large consumption of energy:
	For the first 50 units    -  8.50/- per unit
	For next 200 units       -  13.00/- per unit
	Beyond 250 units        -  18.25/- per unit
All users are charged a minimum of Rs. 850.00. If the total amount is more than Rs. 1500.00 then an additional surcharge of 15% is added.

Write a program to take number of units consumed and print Total Bill Amount.

Assignment #6 : Basic assignments on nested loops :

1. Take range of numbers from user and print tables of all numbers within the given range.
2. Print all prime numbers between given range.
3. Basic pattern printing programs : separate file is shared. 
4. Menu driven program for small hotel menu with sub menu and print total bill amount, when user enter Exit choice.
5. Take a range of numbers and print all perfect numbers within the given range.
